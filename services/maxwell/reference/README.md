## The asymmetry

The defender hashes a candidate solution **once** and counts leading zero bits. The attacker pays an expected **2^d** hashes to find a solution at difficulty `d`. Verification cost is constant; attack cost is exponential.

That asymmetry is the operational expression of **T-IB-09 (Adversarial Dissipation Theorem)** in the Intelligence Bound corpus — Aristotle-verified 2026-05-10, 4/4 theorems mechanically proved under standard axioms. T-IB-09 establishes the formal claim: an attacker capturing N bits under amplification factor `M` dissipates at least `N · M · k_B · T · ln 2` joules, vs. the unprotected Landauer baseline of `N · k_B · T · ln 2`. The corollary (T-IB-09d, attack-irrationality threshold) defines when attack becomes thermodynamically irrational. The companion result T-IB-02 (Adversarial Landauer Inequality, formalization in progress) frames the same asymmetry against statistical detection. The formal statements live in [THEOREMS.md](THEOREMS.md).

The pitch in one sentence: **submission inboxes flooded with AI-generated reports? Put Maxwell's Defense at the gate; the spam now pays the energy bill, not your triagers.**

## In thirty seconds

```bash
pip install maxwells-defense
```

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from maxwells_defense.middleware import FastAPIMaxwellMiddleware
from maxwells_defense.core import StaticDifficultyOracle
import secrets

app = FastAPI()
app.add_middleware(
    FastAPIMaxwellMiddleware,
    server_secret=secrets.token_bytes(32),
    difficulty_oracle=StaticDifficultyOracle(difficulty=18),
    protect_path_prefix="/api/",
)

@app.get("/api/hello")
def hello():
    return {"ok": True}
```

That's it. Any client hitting `/api/*` now receives a 401 with a Maxwell challenge until they spend a few hundred milliseconds of CPU to solve it. JS reference client:

```js
import { fetchWithMaxwell } from "@viridis-security/maxwells-defense";

const res = await fetchWithMaxwell("/api/hello");
console.log(await res.json()); // { ok: true }
```

## Invariants this library commits to

Each invariant has a named regression test. If any of them stops holding, the library is broken — file an issue.

| ID         | Invariant                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MX-INV-1   | Verification cost is O(1) in difficulty (one HMAC, one SHA-256, one bit-count). |
| MX-INV-2   | Solution cost is O(2^d) expected for difficulty `d` leading-zero bits.    |
| MX-INV-3   | Challenges are HMAC-bound to (server_nonce, difficulty, expiry, context). Any tamper is rejected. |
| MX-INV-3a  | Expired challenges are rejected.                                          |
| MX-INV-3b  | Context-id mismatch at verify time is rejected.                           |
| MX-INV-4   | No exploit code path. Public API is lexically free of `attack_*`, `exploit_*`, `bypass_*`, etc. (lint-enforced.) |
| MX-INV-5   | Difficulty oracle is pluggable. The library never hard-codes a policy.    |

## Why not just Cloudflare Turnstile / hCaptcha / mCaptcha?

Use them. They're great at what they do — keeping human visitors past a single-shot human-vs-bot test. Maxwell's Defense addresses a different surface:

- **Agent-aware difficulty.** The oracle takes opaque signals (failed attempts, claimed agent identity, prior interaction history) and returns a difficulty per request. Turnstile is human-vs-bot; Maxwell is *any-actor-vs-attacker-agent*, including legitimate agents that should pass at low difficulty and known-abusive patterns that should pay 2^24 cycles.
- **Self-hostable, no third-party dependency.** Apache-2.0. Drop the middleware into your own service, deploy your own secret. We make zero outbound calls.
- **Open protocol surface.** Every challenge ships an `X-Maxwell-Provider` header so attacker tooling, downstream observers, and audit logs see what's gating the request. Optional hosted-signed-receipts mode (`mcp.viridis-security.com`) lets defenders verify provenance and let agents present cross-site proof-of-work receipts.
- **Theorem-backed.** The asymmetry isn't a heuristic — it's a corpus invariant. See [THEOREMS.md](THEOREMS.md).

## Reference vs. production

This repository ships the **reference primitive**: SHA-256 hashcash, the simplest construction that exhibits the T-IB-09 asymmetry mechanically. It is sufficient for most deployments and is the canonical wire-format implementation.

The **hosted Viridis Maxwell** service (`mcp.viridis-security.com/v1/maxwell/*`) extends this with three production-grade features:

- **Argon2id-pow** instead of SHA-256 — memory-hard, ASIC-resistant. Defeats specialized hardware attackers who would otherwise neutralize SHA-256 PoW with off-the-shelf miners.
- **Amplification levels** (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`extreme`) — adaptive M-factor mapped to per-action thermodynamic-irrationality thresholds (T-IB-09d).
- **Dissipation-receipt binding** + decoy infrastructure — legitimate principals carry receipts that skip PoW; replay attempts face full difficulty + revocation.

The hosted-tier integration is documented at [`services/maxwell/README.md`](https://github.com/viridis-security/mcp-services-sdk/blob/main/services/maxwell/README.md) in the parent SDK repository.

Free tier: 100K challenges/month, no card. Bundled with MCP-02 (Growth tier and above). Enterprise: high-value agent deployments — [viridissecurity1@gmail.com](mailto:viridissecurity1@gmail.com).

## Status

`0.1.0` — alpha. The primitive is small (~250 LOC of crypto in core), tested across two languages, with proven wire-format interop. We expect breaking changes in 0.x while we add the federated-difficulty oracle and signed-receipt flow. Pin to a specific version in production.

## Testing

```bash
# Python (17 invariant tests)
cd python && pip install -e ".[test]" && pytest tests/ -v

# JS↔Python interop
cd javascript && node tests/interop.test.mjs
```
